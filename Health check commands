# Once docker container is created switch to non root user
su elasticsearch

# Elasticsearch tells the JVM to use a heap with a minimum and maximum size of 1 GB by default , so we need to change heap minimum and maximum size.
go to -------> cd config ------->vi jvm.options 

# change the heap size below mentioned location based upon the requirement 

# Xms represents the initial size of total heap space
# Xmx represents the maximum size of total heap space
-Xms1g ---------> -Xms4g   (based on requirement)
-Xmx1g ---------> -Xms4g   (based on requirement)

# Then start elasticsearch
./bin/ealstcisearch&

# Do the health checks using below commands
curl localhost:9200/_cat/health
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true"
curl -X GET "localhost:9200"
